# Assignment-5
So Because I do not have enough time to finish this Assignment (very busy these days)so I only make a process work
in the process work show my game design thinking,and include some basic hand write code, sketches etc..

How to play this game. this is a Space Gun. (my idea is from topgun this movie)
Player control the spaceship to shoot bullets to hit the badpeople. player can move left and right. 
If player touch badpeople for more than 3 times, game over
